(Total points does not change as questions are added but the points on the question itself updates to reflect the pooled question value.)

			This will test creating a pool using a section that already has questions.Verify: - The total  of questions is correctly populated in the pool info as soon as you check the box (or open the edit pool selection). - The  of pooled questions is displaying in the section header - The total  of points is being displayed correctly (the questions will now all have the same point value).
			This will give you a third pool to play with.As you move each question in, the total  of questions should increase each time but the pooled  of questions (manually assigned) should not.Additionally, the point value for each questions will change to reflect the current pool.
			This tests editing a pool.The question and points will be correctly reflected in the headers.
			This tests deleting pool values.The total point value should be changed now that this is no longer pooled.


			Verify that the Take side is pullnig x out of x questions for each pool.Verify that the non-pooled section is displaying all 7 questions.Verify that the points listed for each section is correct.Verify that each student has different questions from the pooled sections and that they are in a randomized order.

			Verify that the Performance graph displays as expected.  Because there was a wide variety of responses, the middle bar should be tallest and displayed as green.The Performance non-graph data should be correctly populated (Questions, Participants, Mean, etc.) - Mean is the average of the highest and lowest scores. - Mode is the most frequent grade.  In this case because there are no two scores alike all results will be listed here.Ensure that the Participants Graph correctly reflects the results.  (X axis is % score.  Y axis is  of users that received said score and is dynamic.)  In this case because there are no two scores alike, X axis will be one person and will have that value on each of the five scores received.
			Verify that the Performance graph displays as expected.  Because the response falls in 0-19%, the left bar should be tallest and displayed as red.The Performance non-graph data should be correctly populated (Questions, Participants, Mean, etc.) - Mean is the average of the highest and lowest scores. - Mode is the most frequent grade.  In this case because there are no two scores alike all results will be listed here.Ensure that the Participants Graph correctly reflects the results.  (X axis is % score.  Y axis is  of users that received said score and is dynamic.)
			Verify that the Performance graph displays as expected.  Because the response falls in 20-44%, the second-to-left bar should be tallest and displayed as yellow/orange.The Performance non-graph data should be correctly populated (Questions, Participants, Mean, etc.) - Mean is the average of the highest and lowest scores. - Mode is the most frequent grade.  In this case because there are no two scores alike all results will be listed here.Ensure that the Participants Graph correctly reflects the results.  (X axis is % score.  Y axis is  of users that received said score and is dynamic.)
			Verify that the Performance graph displays as expected.  Because the response falls in45-75%, the middle bar should be tallest and displayed as green.The Performance non-graph data should be correctly populated (Questions, Participants, Mean, etc.) - Mean is the average of the highest and lowest scores. - Mode is the most frequent grade.  In this case because there are no two scores alike all results will be listed here.Ensure that the Participants Graph correctly reflects the results.  (X axis is % score.  Y axis is  of users that received said score and is dynamic.)
			Verify that the Performance graph displays as expected.  Because the response falls in 75-90%, the second-to-right bar should be tallest and displayed as yellow/orange.The Performance non-graph data should be correctly populated (Questions, Participants, Mean, etc.) - Mean is the average of the highest and lowest scores. - Mode is the most frequent grade.  In this case because there are no two scores alike all results will be listed here.Ensure that the Participants Graph correctly reflects the results.  (X axis is % score.  Y axis is  of users that received said score and is dynamic.)
			Verify that the Performance graph displays as expected.  Because there were two responses for 90-100%, the right bar should be tallest and displayed as red.The Performance non-graph data should be correctly populated (Questions, Participants, Mean, etc.) - Mean is the average of the highest and lowest scores. - Mode is the most frequent grade.  In this case because there are two instances of 100%, that grade will be posted here.Ensure that the Participants Graph correctly reflects the results.  (X axis is % score.  Y axis is  of users that received said score and is dynamic.)  In this case the X axis will be equal to two people which is what will be displayed at the 100% mark.  The other scores will all have a 1 for the axis which is equal to half of the height of the graph.
